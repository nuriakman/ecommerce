# The checklist for a new e-commerce website

Check out this ultimate checklist if you are starting an e-commerce business to get ready to compete and succeed.

Starting an e-commerce website is a challenging, time-consuming task, requiring substantial funds allocated specifically for the purpose. If you are a resourceful businessman and have made up your mind to go digital and seize the opportunities electronic commerce can offer, there are items that need to be checked and double-checked. Here is an ultimate checklist of six questions for every new e-commerce website owner to consider before hitting the stormy waters. 

Remember to ask yourself or the ecommerce website developers you collaborate with these questions before you set out on a journey. The probability is high that your adventure will yield better results than you could ever expect. 

## 1 Are your website design and layout appealing and user-friendly?
- The first impression really matters, and it is still all about the looks. Website visitors are very fast these days. It takes them less than five seconds to estimate the site and form an opinion. To make them stay and explore and ultimately clinch a deal requires the miracles of ingenuity. The design, layout, speed, and user-friendly navigation should all be there to do their part of the job.

## 2 Does the product page include all the necessary and useful information?
- After your prospective customer has found your site, they potentially land on a product page. This is the moment when the product page plays a significant role to simplify the process of making a choice and pushing the buy button. Clear, detailed product description including dimensions, weight, material, color, washing instructions, etc. is always helpful. No important feature should be left out.
- Customer reviews, placed on the product page, double the chances that the visitors will choose the product they need, on the condition most of the feedbacks are positive, of course. 
- Calls to action should also be subtly integrated into the interface to leave a customer no doubt as for where to go next. Any useful information on pricing, discounts, potential sales, availability or scarcity stimulates people to buy. So, it is a good idea to keep buyers informed.

## 3 Do you use the potential of a blog to add value to the website
- One of your primary goals is to stand out from your competitors. It is, undoubtedly, a challenge but it is definitely worth investing your time, money and effort. Moreover, you want to show search engines that your site goes beyond the framework of selling staff. Your site is a platform to communicate news, share ideas, inform about recent and upcoming events and many more. Some additional items located on completely separate pages can create a better image for your brand and substantially strengthen it.

## 4 Do the Wishlist Shopping cart walk customers through the buying process?
- If you are armed with some good strategic advice on how to exploit the potential of such e-commerce site structural elements as the Wishlist and Shopping cart, you are halfway to the success. These two functions are bread and butter if appropriately used. For instance, allowing customers to save their cart to a Wishlist for later, suggesting products on the Wishlist to upsell during checkout or showing buyers how much theyâ€™ve saved are just a few ideas to put into practice on your website.

## 5 Are there support pages included on your e-commerce site?
- It is nice to understand the role of support pages and see which of them need to be incorporated into your website. Social media pages, forums, FAQs, 24/7 customer support are irreplaceable if you want your potential customers to feel connected, go through the buying process smoothly and come back to your website for the products you sell as well as for the pleasant purchasing experience.

## 6 Are you following up with the customers?
- This is the last but not the least question to answer for a successful online business. To follow up often meant to turn a random buyer into a loyal customer. Once someone makes an order with your website, you have an opportunity to offer support after the purchase. If you send a one or two weeks follow-up to thank for the purchase and inquire how the product is, a customer will definitely appreciate not being left alone with the questions on the product, appearing during the usage of it.

Afterwards, you offer to join a loyalty program and chances are high that the offer is going to be accepted. Later you can include into your email a request to write a review or share a link on social media in exchange for discounts or specials, an offer to buy gift cards or to receive notification alerts for specials or new products.
