# The Ultimate Checklist for Every New Ecommerce Site

When you start an ecommerce site you realize that there are loads of items that need to be checked, cross-checked and tested to ensure that your customers have a nice experience. That’s why I put together an expansive checklist for new ecommerce sites.

Walk through the list and mark off when you complete each item to ensure that your ecommerce site is ready for selling.
